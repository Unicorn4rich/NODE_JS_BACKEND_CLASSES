# Node.js Backend Project: Router, Controller, and Middleware Setup

This `README.md` file contains detailed notes based on a YouTube tutorial explaining how to structure a Node.js backend project by separating **routes**, **controllers**, and **middleware**. The focus is on organizing code for a book management API, covering file structure, function exports, imports, and middleware integration. These notes are designed for students to understand the flow and key concepts, including practical steps and important takeaways.

## Project Overview
The tutorial demonstrates how to organize a Node.js backend project by:
- Separating **routes** (handling API endpoints) and **controllers** (handling business logic).
- Setting up a **middleware** to process requests before they reach the controller.
- Using a simple book management API with endpoints to:
  - Get all books (`GET /books`).
  - Get a book by ID (`GET /books/:id`).
  - Create a new book (`POST /books`).
  - Update a book (`PATCH /books/:id`).
- Testing the API using **Thunder Client** to ensure all endpoints work correctly.

The project uses **Express.js** as the web framework, with a main server file (`index.js`), a router file (`book.route.js`), a controller file (`book.controller.js`), and a middleware file (`book.middleware.js`).

## Key Concepts Learned
1. **Router**: Defines API endpoints (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`) and maps them to specific functions.
2. **Controller**: Contains the business logic (functions) for handling requests, keeping the router clean.
3. **Middleware**: Functions that process requests before they reach the controller, e.g., for validation or logging.
4. **Modular Code**: Organizing code into separate files (routes, controllers, middleware) for scalability and maintainability.
5. **Export/Import**: Using `module.exports` to share functions between files and `require` to import them.
6. **Request Flow**: 
   - Client → Server (`index.js`) → Router (`book.route.js`) → Middleware (if any) → Controller (`book.controller.js`) → Response to Client.

## Folder Structure
The project follows a clean folder structure at the **root directory**:
